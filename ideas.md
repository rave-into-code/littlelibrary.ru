What may be desired to be done.
===============================
(some time in the future)
-------------------------

* Localization.
* Ticket of the week.
* Statistics of growth.

We represent little libraries.
------------------------------
Each is a ticket.
There's this list of tickets.

Then there's news and comments associated.


I'd like to have a ticket integrated with the web.
So, there's these event channels: 
* twitter -- we could 140 each event.
* vk/facebook -- ???
* Instagram -- we could host our imagery here.


However, besides tickets there's this *PROJECT* in general.
===========================================================

Not just one, but an umbrella of projects that has to be designed.
* bookcrossing.com
* littlelibrary.ru (?)
* vk communities.

It is a people's project, widest open.

There has to be an appealing presentation on the first page.

Data design is simple.
